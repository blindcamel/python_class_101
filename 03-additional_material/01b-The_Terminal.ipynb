    "# Terminals/Command Line Interface (CLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the terminal\n",
    "A terminal is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with your computer using text commands. It provides a way to navigate your computer's file system, run programs, and perform various tasks without the need for a graphical user interface. While it may seem intimidating at first, learning to use the terminal can be very empowering and efficient once you become familiar with its basic commands and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why learning the terminal is important for developers\n",
    "Learning to use the terminal is important for aspiring developers for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficiency: Using the terminal can be much faster and more efficient than using a graphical user interface for many tasks, especially when working with code or performing system-level tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Automation: The terminal can be used to automate repetitive tasks and create scripts to perform complex tasks, which can save time and reduce errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Debugging: Many programming languages and development tools use the terminal for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Collaboration: Many software development workflows involve using the terminal to interact with version control systems, build tools, and deployment pipelines, so it's essential to be comfortable using the terminal when working with other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Flexibility: The terminal provides a way to interact with a wide variety of tools and systems, making it an essential tool for developers working with a range of technologies and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's the difference between the terminal and the shell\n",
    "A shell is a program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with an operating system. It takes commands from the user and executes them by interacting with the operating system's kernel. The shell provides various features such as command history, auto-completion, and scripting capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a terminal is a hardware device or software application that provides a user interface for accessing the shell. It provides a way to interact with the shell by displaying the output of shell commands and allowing the user to input new commands. In other words, a terminal is a window that displays the output of the shell and allows the user to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern computing, the terms \"shell\" and \"terminal\" are often used interchangeably, and many people refer to the terminal as the \"command-line interface.\" However, technically speaking, a shell is a program that runs within the terminal, and the terminal is the application that provides the interface for the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Here's an example of a shell script you might find useful\n",
    "To the point of automating your terminal commands and making them collaborative, you may find it tedious to install python libraries over and over again on new systems. You may also worry that other developers or users will have trouble managing these resources as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a shell script we could write that would check for the user that the appropriate version of Python is installed, update necessary resources like pip, setup and activate a virtual environment, then install the required packages from a provies `requirements.txt` file.\n",
    "### `install_dependencies.sh`\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#! /bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "if python -c 'import sys; assert sys.version_info <= (3,8)' > /dev/null; then\n",
    "\n",
    "    # update necessary python resources at global level\n",
    "    python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel pip\n",
    "\n",
    "    # setup and activate virtual environment\n",
    "    python -m venv .venv\n",
    "    source \"./.venv/bin/activate\" && python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel pip\n",
    "\n",
    "    if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then\n",
    "        # install from requirements\n",
    "        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "    fi\n",
    "\n",
    "else\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"python version should be <= 3.8\"\n",
    "exit \n",
    "\n",
    "fi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful commands to know:\n",
    "Here are some of the most common and important shell commands to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "`ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd`: Changes the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mkdir`: Creates a new directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`rm`: Deletes files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cp`: Copies files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mv`: Moves or renames files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cat`: Displays the contents of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`grep`: Searches for a pattern in a file or input.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ps`: Lists the currently running processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`kill`: Terminates a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "`chmod`: Changes the permissions of a file or directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ssh`: Connects to a remote computer using Secure Shell (SSH).\n",
    "\n",
    "`tar`: Archives files into a compressed file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`curl`: Downloads files from the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "`echo`: Prints a message to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the most commonly used shell commands. There are many other commands available, and their usage can vary depending on the operating system and the specific shell being used. Learning to use these commands efficiently can help improve productivity and simplify common tasks in the terminal."
