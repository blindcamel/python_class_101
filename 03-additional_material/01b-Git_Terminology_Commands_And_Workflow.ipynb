    "# Git Terms\n",
    "Rebasing and merging are two different ways to integrate changes from one branch to another in version control systems like Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Git**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Repository**: A collection of files and directories that make up a project, along with the version history and metadata associated with the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Commit**: A snapshot of changes to a set of files at a particular point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and metadata such as author, date, and commit message.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Branch**: A separate line of development within a repository, used to isolate changes and collaborate on new features or bug fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another, resulting in a new commit that incorporates the changes from both branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Rebase**: A way of integrating changes from one branch to another by moving the entire branch to the tip of the target branch, creating a linear history. This can be useful for maintaining a clean and organized history, but can also be complex and require resolving conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Merge conflict**: A situation that occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from one branch into another, typically because there are conflicting changes to the same file or lines of code. Resolving merge conflicts requires manual intervention to decide which changes should be kept and which should be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Pull request**: A proposed set of changes to a repository, typically used for collaboration and review.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Fork**: A copy of a repository that allows you to make changes to the codebase without affecting the original project.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Clone**: A local copy of a repository that allows you to make changes and push them back to the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Remote**: A version of a repository hosted on a server, such as GitHub, that can be accessed by multiple users.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Issue**: A problem or task related to a project that is tracked in the repository, typically used for bug tracking and project management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some common Git commands\n",
    "Sure, here are some commonly used Git commands along with brief explanations of what they do:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git init`: Creates a new Git repository in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git clone`: Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git add`: Adds changes to the staging area, preparing them to be committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git commit`: Records changes to the repository, creating a new commit with a message describing the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git status`: Shows the current status of the repository, including any changes that have been made since the last commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository or creates a new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git checkout`: Switches between different branches or commits in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git merge`: Combines changes from one branch into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git push`: Sends commits from your local repository to a remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into your local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git fetch`: Retrieves changes from a remote repository, but does not merge them.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git log`: Displays a list of all commits in the repository, along with their metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git diff`: Shows the differences between files or commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git stash`: Temporarily saves changes that are not ready to be committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git remote`: Manages connections to remote repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git workflow example\n",
    "Sure, here's an example Git workflow that you might use when working on a software development project with a team:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new branch: Before making any changes, create a new branch for the feature or bug fix you will be working on. This isolates your changes from the main branch, allowing you to work on the feature without disrupting other work being done on the project. You can create a new branch using the command `git checkout -b <new-branch>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make changes: Once you have created a new branch, make changes to the code to implement the feature or fix the bug. Use `git add` to stage changes, and `git commit` to create a new commit with a descriptive commit message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull changes: Before pushing your changes to the remote repository, pull any changes that have been made to the main branch since you created your new branch. This ensures that your changes are based on the latest version of the code. You can do this using `git pull origin main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Push changes: Once you have made and committed your changes, push them to the remote repository using `git push origin <new-branch>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a pull request: Once your changes have been pushed to the remote repository, create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch. This allows other team members to review and comment on your changes before they are merged. You can create a pull request on GitHub or using the `git request-pull` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolve merge conflicts: If there are any merge conflicts between your branch and the main branch, you will need to resolve them before your changes can be merged. Use `git merge` to merge changes from the main branch into your feature branch, and then resolve any conflicts that arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge changes: Once any conflicts have been resolved and your changes have been reviewed and approved, merge your changes into the main branch using the `git merge` command or by clicking the \"merge\" button on the pull request page in GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delete branch: After your changes have been merged, delete your feature branch using the `git branch -d <new-branch>` command."
