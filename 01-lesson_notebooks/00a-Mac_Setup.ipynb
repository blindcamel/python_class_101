    "# Mac setup\n",
    "## Tools you will need\n",
    "We're also recommending tools and steps that will give a good baseline to grow as a developer. You will need the following tools and applicatiosn for this course:\n",
    "- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS that allows you to easily install and manage software packages from the command line. It provides a convenient way to install and update common development tools, programming languages, and other utilities.\n",
    "- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a simple Python version manager that allows you to easily switch between multiple versions of Python on your local machine. It provides a way to install and manage different versions of Python, as well as the ability to create virtual environments for specific projects.\n",
    "- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (often referred to as VS Code) is a free and open-source cross-platform code editor developed by Microsoft. It provides a rich set of features for editing, debugging, and working with code, including support for multiple programming languages, code completion, and Git integration. It is also highly customizable through extensions and themes.\\*\n",
    "- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is often used for data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning.\n",
    "- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open-source distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to your code over time. It is widely used in software development to collaborate on projects and manage code changes.\n",
    "- [Github](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It allows developers to collaborate on projects, track issues and bugs, and contribute to open-source projects. It is also a popular platform for hosting documentation and project websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*If you want to fight the power, you can dowload [VS Codium]((https://vscodium.com/)), essentially open source VS Code without the Microsoft.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing\n",
    "We can get all of these tools via the Mac's [terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac). We describe terminals and command line interfaces in the notebook [01a-Some_Context](../01-lesson_notebooks/01a-Some_Context.ipynb) and give even more detail in the 03-additional_material section [01b-The_Terminal](../03-additional_material/01b-The_Terminal.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find your termnal with the \"Spotlight Search\". You can pull it up easily by clicking the `<command>` + `<space>` keys together and typing \"terminal\" and select.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download and install Homebrew\n",
    "Make sure you have adminstrative priveleges and then copy the installation command from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) into your terminal and hit enter to run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add `brew` to your PATH\n",
    "The PATH is used to help your computer know where to look for the software programs that you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "After `brew` is finished installing you'll probably receive a prompt that is roughly like the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "==> Next steps:\n",
    "- Add Homebrew to your PATH in /Users/ralphjsmit/.zprofile:\n",
    "    echo 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' >> /Users/<your user name>/.zprofile\n",
    "    eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open a new terminal with `<command>` + `<n>` keys. Go ahead and close out of your old one. Check that brew downloaded successfully by calling the command `brew update` in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download and install `pyenv`\n",
    "You can find [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)'s installation instructions on their GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following their installation instructions via `brew` we an perform the following commands:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew update\n",
    "brew install pyenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Add `pyenv` to your PATH and shell environment\n",
    "We're assuming you're using the [`zsh`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/zsh#:~:text=Zsh%20is%20a%20UNIX%20command,ksh%20but%20includes%20many%20enhancements.) shell (default on Macs). Therefore, you'd run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo 'export PYENV_ROOT=\"$HOME/.pyenv\"' >> ~/.zshrc\n",
    "echo 'command -v pyenv >/dev/null || export PATH=\"$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.zshrc\n",
    "echo 'eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"' >> ~/.zshrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can refresh our shell with the command `source ~/.zshrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can confirm the `pyenv` commands work by running `pyenv version`. There shouldn't be anything, but if the command is recongized, we should be good.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Python with `pyenv`\n",
    "Depending on which version of the Mac you're running you probably already have Python 2 or Python 3 installed. You can confirm by running `python --version` and/or `python3 --version`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we want more control over which python versions we have, and at some point in our journey as developers, an easy way to switch between different versions of Python to work with the latest and greatest or the legacy versions that the applications we end up working on require.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time this is written, Python version `3.11.1` is the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's install it in our terminal with the command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pyenv install 3.11.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's set this as our \"global\" version with the command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pyenv global 3.11.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we can refresh our shell again with the command `source ~/.zshrc`. If we call `python --version` we should see `3.11.1` being called from the `.pyenv` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also check that `pip`, the default package installer for Python that allows you to easily install and manage Python packages and dependencies is linked correction by running `which pip` in our terminal. It should match the same directory when we run `which python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is good enough for our purposes, but if you're interested in understanding `pyenv` broader use case [*Real Python*](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/) has a pretty good rundown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download and install `jupyter`\n",
    "To access and interact the workbook materials for this course, we'll need a Python package [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install). Python has a conveninent way to pull its own packages with `pip`. Let's install it in our global site-packages for Python 3.11.1 (which we should have set previously).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's as simple as running the command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check that you have it by running `jupyter --version`. We'll go over how to use this application in future workbooks. It's enough that we have it successfully downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download and install VS Code\n",
    "Since we're pros at installing with `brew` we can do it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's follow [HomeBrew's documentation](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/visual-studio-code) and run the command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install --cask visual-studio-code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it's done installing, you should be able to search for it in your applications. We can also verify that VS Code commands have been properly applied to our PATH. Try running `code --version`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also try the command `code .` (`.` is short hand for our current directory) to see all of our files and folders inside VS Code. We'll go over how to use this when we download our materials in an upcoming notebook"
