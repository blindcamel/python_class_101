    "Additionally, it's worth mentioning that in Python, indentation is **MANDATORY** and must be consistent throughout the code. This means that each code block must be indented to the same level, and every line within a block must have the same indentation. Mixing spaces and tabs for indentation is not recommended, as it can cause issues with code readability and portability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it's important to note that changing the indentation level of a code block can change its meaning, and can lead to unexpected results. For example, an if statement that is indented correctly to indicate that a block of code should be executed only if a certain condition is met, may not work as expected if the indentation is incorrect.\n",

    "Proper indentation is essential for writing correct and readable Python code, and should be given careful consideration when writing or modifying code. Consistent indentation and adherence to recommended conventions can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of your code."
