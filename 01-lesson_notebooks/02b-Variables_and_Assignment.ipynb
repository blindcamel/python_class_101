    "## Static Typing vs. Dynamic Typing\n",

    "my_number = 'fifty-seven'\n",

    "**For this exact reason, many popular languages use a system called static typing, whereby a variable type must be intially defined and cannot change without a properly defined operation. Python has added some capability to approximate static typing in later versions (while under the hood still not technically being static typing). This functionaltiy in Python will not be specifically covered in this iteration of this course, but it's worth understanding as it is commonly implemented among development teams that use Python.**\n",

    "## Type Hinting\n",
    "Type hinting is a feature in Python that allows you to specify the expected data type of an argument or a variable in a function or a class. This information is not used by the Python interpreter at runtime, but it can be used by tools like IDEs, linters, and type checkers to provide better feedback to the developer, improve code documentation, and catch potential bugs early in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hints are specified using annotations in the form of comments or strings immediately after the argument, parameter, or variable declaration. For example, the following function takes a string argument and returns an integer:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name: str = \"Tuan Nguyen\"\n",
    "age: int = 33\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `: str` annotation after `name` indicates that `name` is a string variable, and the `: int` annotation after `age` indicates that `age` is an integer variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to keep in mind that type hints are technically only suggestions, and the Python interpreter will not enforce them at runtime like a compiler in a dynamically typed language. If you need to enforce the types of arguments or variables, you can use a type checker like [`mypy`](https://www.mypy-lang.org/)."

    "## Best practice and what we'll do going forward in the course\n",
    "Type hinting is optional in Python, but it is considered a best practice to provide type hints in your code whenever possible, especially in larger projects where code documentation and maintainability are important. Actually \"declaring\" our types is far more common, especially in really influential langauges like C, C#, C++, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we'll treate type hinting as Gospel and use it in the training materials and in project solutions. We believe this will help fulfill the aim of learning good GENERAL programming practices and not overly niche language specific knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hinting is an important tool that your future self will be glad you took the time to implement in your program when you inevitably forget what you originally intended only days after you wrote the code to begin with."
