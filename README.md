# python_class

This project is intended to provide a base of exercises and explanations for anyone to learn or review python.

The materials are grouped by "concept" but can obviously be arranged in any order for conducsive learning.

## Key goals
While much of the material is presented in jupyter notebooks so anyone can read lesson material and follow along, there are also a collection of practice exercises that are meant to be solved in a traditional IDE (pycharm, vscode, atom, etc.)

## How you can help
Practice makes perfect. Effective practice problems dedicated to every learning concept is important. While expository material and explanations given in the Jupyter Notebooks can certainly be adapted and improved, providing more "IDE Practice Problems" is where most learning will happen at the end of the day. Contributing problems as "READMEs" and solutions as .py files is probably the most needed contribution.
