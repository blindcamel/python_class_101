# python_class

This project is intended to provide a base of exercises and explanations for anyone to learn or review the basics of programming with the Python programming language.

Consists of two basic components:
* Jupyter Notebooks outlining essential concepts in programming.
* A corresponding larger project exercise, intended to be built in an IDE (program assumes VS Code), is also included in the IDE_excecises folder.

## How to use the materials
Lesson notebooks are arranged by topic. Each notebook contains explanations and examples of the topic for that section. Basic exercies and solutions are also included and can be practiced in the notebook or in another enviornment of your choice.

Each week has a corresponding "IDE Exerice". A usually, larger project that you should practice building in the IDE of your choice. I'm generally assuming you're using VS Code as your IDE in the included notes. A README is included with each IDE exercise giving the explanation.

## How you can help
Practice makes perfect. Effective practice problems dedicated to every learning concept is important. While expository material and explanations given in the Jupyter Notebooks can certainly be adapted and improved, providing more "IDE Practice Problems" is where most learning will happen at the end of the day.

Please consider adding a README outlining a problem and a corresponding solution. Also please consider reviewing other solutions and adapting them to improve readability and other core programming principles.

## TODO:
* add exercise to count occurence of vowels in string
* add exercise to count occurence of set of strings in total strings
* add exercise that prints the longest substring of string s in which letters occur in alphabetical order
* Add Jupyter notebook run explanations to 01b
* Add "tools you will need" jupyter notebook or README
* Finish 7b presentation...
* Finish 7b Notes by adding the pictures
* Add tests for IDE project solutions
