# python_class

This project is intended to provide a base of exercises and explanations for anyone to learn or review python.

The materials are grouped by "concept" but can obviously be arranged in any order for conducsive learning.

## Key goals
While much of the material is presented in jupyter notebooks so anyone can read lesson material and follow along, there are also a collection of practice exercises that are meant to be solved in a traditional IDE (pycharm, vscode, atom, etc.)

## How you can help
Practice makes perfect. Effective practice problems dedicated to every learning concept is important. While expository material and explanations given in the Jupyter Notebooks can certainly be adapted and improved, providing more "IDE Practice Problems" is where most learning will happen at the end of the day. Contributing problems as "READMEs" and solutions as .py files is probably the most needed contribution.

## Suggested Lesson Plan
There are a lot of different ways to learn Python. You could go in order of the material as it is literally stored in this project, but that would be less than ideal in many an experienced programmer's opinion. The topics in the Lesson Materials are grouped by subject and ordered BROADLY by difficulty. However, simply studying from the easiest to the hardest isn't necessarily the best.

Here's my preferred study order for the pure basics:
1. Numbers
2. Assignment
3. Conditional Statements
4. While Loops and For Loops
5. Functions
6. Tuples and Lists
7. Dictionaries
8. Classes and Methods

## TODO:
* add exercise to count occurence of vowels in string
* add exercise to count occurence of set of strings in total strings
* add exercise that prints the longest substring of string s in which letters occur in alphabetical order
* Add Jupyter notebook run explanations to 01b
* Add "tools you will need" jupyter notebook or README
* Finish 7b presentation...
