# python_class

This project is intended to provide a base of exercises and explanations for anyone to learn or review python.

The materials are grouped by "concept" but can obviously be arranged in any order for conducsive learning.

## How to use the materials
Lesson notebooks are arranged by topic. Each notebook contains explanations and examples of the topic for that section. Basic exercies and solutions are also included and can be practiced in the notebook or in another enviornment of your choice.

Each week has a corresponding "IDE Exerice". A usually, larger project that you should practice building in the IDE of your choice. I'm generally assuming you're using VS studio code. A README is included with each IDE exercise giving the explanation.

## How you can help
Practice makes perfect. Effective practice problems dedicated to every learning concept is important. While expository material and explanations given in the Jupyter Notebooks can certainly be adapted and improved, providing more "IDE Practice Problems" is where most learning will happen at the end of the day. Contributing problems as "READMEs" and solutions as .py files is probably the most needed contribution.
