# python_class

This project is intended to provide a base of exercises and explanations for anyone to learn or review the basics of programming with the Python programming language.

Consists of two basic components:
* Jupyter Notebooks outlining essential concepts in programming. These are stored in the "01-lesson_notebooks" directory.
* A corresponding larger project exercise, intended to be built in an IDE (program assumes VS Code), is also included in the IDE_excecises folder. These are stored in the "IDE_exercises" directory.

## How to use the materials
Lesson notebooks are arranged by topic. Each notebook contains explanations and examples of the programming principles concept for that section. Basic exercies and solutions are also included and can be practiced in the notebook directly

Each lesson set has a corresponding "IDE Exercise". This is a project with a larger scope that you should practice building in the IDE of your choice. I'm generally assuming you're using VS Code as your IDE in the included notes. A README is included with each IDE exercise giving the explanation.

## How you can help
Practice makes perfect. Effective practice problems dedicated to every learning concept is important. While expository material and explanations given in the Jupyter Notebooks can certainly be adapted and improved, providing more "IDE Practice Problems" is themost needed ask.

Please consider adding a README outlining a problem and also providing a corresponding .py file solution. Pleae also consider reviewing other solutions and adapting them to improve readability and good programming practice. Please remember that this is a programming principles course. Not a optimal list comprehension course... Let's focus on generally good, multi-language programming principles covered here.
