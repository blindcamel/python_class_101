    "How do you get from a set of requirements to a working program? There is no cut-and-dried recipe to follow. If there were, someone would write an app for it, and programmers would be out of a job. It can be tempting to just sit down at the keyboard and start typing out code, and that might even work okay for tiny simple problems, but for anything else, it can easily get you into a time-wasting morass of errors that you're not sure how to fix. To help you avoid that outcome, here are some general principles you can follow to help guide you toward a solution:\n",

You may also think of something I haven't considered, in which case you should ask me for clarification."

    "It's important to come up with test cases that are representative of how your code could be used. You want them to be good enough that if your code passes all your tests, you will feel confident that it correctly meets all of the requirements. It's also important that for each test, you decide what result(s) you expect from that test. If you don't do that ahead of time, then it can be easy to run a test, briefly look at the output, and convince yourself that it looks reasonable.\n",
