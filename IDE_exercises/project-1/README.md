# project-1

Create a Python file named my_color.py.  Type the following code into the file, but with **your name** and the **current date**:
```
# Author: Brandon Hoffman
# Date: 04/15/1865
# Description: Asks the user for their favorite color and then
#              prints out a statement with the variable

fave_color = input("Please enter your favorite color: ")
print("Your favorite color is  " + fave_color + ".")
```
Now save the file ("File/Save All") and run it.  The program should ask you to enter the name of your favorite animal, and after you do, it will print out "Your favorite color is \<whatever you typed\>."
